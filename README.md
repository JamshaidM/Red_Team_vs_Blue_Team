# Red Team vs Blue Team

This is Red Team vs Blue Team activity where I performed roles of both a penetration tester and a SOC analyst.

First, I played the role of a penetration tester gaining unauthorized access to a company web server and utilizing a PHP reverse shell to establish a Meterpreter session allowing for exfilteration of company data. Then, I performed the role of a SOC analyst analyzing the Kibana logs to summarize the incident and recommending system hardening. 

This was a good hands on excercise to gain insight into both offensive and defensive security roles. This included application of knowledge of following skills and tools:
- Penetration testing with Kali Linux.
- Log and incident analysis with Kibana.
- System hardening and configuration.
- Reporting, documentation, and communication.

The project report was created in Microsoft Power Point. PDF version of the report is available [here](Red_vs_Blue_Project.pdf). The report includes following details:
- Network Topology
- Network Reconnaissance
- Vulnerability Assessment
- Exploit Summary
- Incident Analysis
- Mitigation Strategies
